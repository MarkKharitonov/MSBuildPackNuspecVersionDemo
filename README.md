# MSBuildPackNuspecVersionDemo
A tiny project to demo the nuspec version generated by the msbuild pack target

Run build.ps1 to see the results:

```Powershell
C:\work\PackVersionTest [master ≡]> .\build.ps1
Building ...
Packing ...
Dll Product Version = 1.2.3.4+8d50ec0
Nuspec Version = 1.2.3.4
C:\work\PackVersionTest [master ≡]>
```

I wonder if it is possible to have Nuspec version the same as the Dll Product version. The relevant SO question is
